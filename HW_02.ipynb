    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will review Gauss' law (equivalent to Coulomb's law) and understand its limitations.  We will then use the superposition principle and Coulomb's law to calculate the field of a spherical charge distribution and a cube of charge.  We will compare these solutions to each other and to the analytic solution for a spherical charge distribution from Gauss' law.\n",

    "This notebook is divided into three sections.  We first review Gauss' law, next we review how to do integration with Python (you will need this to apply the superposition principle to compute the field of the sphere and cube).  The final section is the two assignments.  The first assignment, homework 3, is to calculate the electric field.  In the next assignment, we will compute the electric potential."

    "## Gauss' Law\n",
    "\n",
    "Gauss' law is mathematically equivalent to Coulomb's law.  It expresses a relation between the electrostatic flux ($\\Phi_E$) through a closed surface and the charge enclosed ($Q$) through the following relation:  $$\\Phi_E \\equiv \\oint_{surface} \\vec E \\cdot d\\vec A  = \\frac {Q_{encl}} {\\epsilon_0}. $$  It is often convenient to remember that the charge enclosed can be expressed as an integral over the volume enclosed by the bounding surface of Gauss' law: $Q_{encl} = \\iiint_{volume} \\rho dV$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You have complete choice over which surface to integrate over.  This freedom can be used to make arguments about the distribution of charges in conductors or to calculate the field in cases with a high degree of symmetry.   To calculate $\\vec E$ using this law you must find a surface on which the electric field magnitude is constant and the field is always normal to the surface.   This means you need either continuous translation symmetry (e.g., a plane or the axial direction of a cylinder), or/and a continuous rotation symmetry (eg a specially symmetric charge distribution or the azimuthal direction of a cylindrically symmetric charge distribution).  In cases which have these symmetries this is the best way to calculate the field.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many charge distributions that don't have this symmetry.  In that case you must resort to other techniques including superposition. For continuous charge distributions, superposition takes the form of an integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Superposition\n",
    "In the previous exercise we presented superposition as the rule that the field from two souerces is the vector sum of both.  It is easy to extend this to a continuous distribution of charges:  $$\\vec E(\\vec r)  = \\frac {1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}  \\iiint_{\\mathrm{charge~distribution}} \\frac {\\hat {\\mathscr r}}{{\\mathscr r}^2}  {\\rho dV}.$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that $\\vec {\\mathscr r} = \\vec r - \\vec r_{charge} $.  In other words, $\\vec {\\mathscr r}$ depends on the variables you are integrating over.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical Integration\n",
    "For the purposes of numerical computation recall that the integral is defined as the limit of a Riemann sum:  $\\iiint f(r) dV = \\lim_{\\Delta V \\to 0}  \\sum_{\\mathrm{volume~elements}} f(r) \\Delta V$.  In other words an integral is calculated by dividing the integration volume into lots of small chunks, evaluating the function at the center of these chunks, multiplying them by the volume of the chunk and then summing over all chunks.  With a computer we can't make the chunks infinitely small, but if we make them small enough we can calculate the integral to sufficient precision.   (Lots of care is needed in choosing what precision is needed and verifying that you have met that requirement.)\n",
    "### NumPy\n",
    "We will be using routines from the NumPy library.  The users guide for NumPy is at http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/\n",
